## 🔍 1. Challenge Description
The server logs seem to leak pieces of a secret flag.
The fragments are scattered, repeated, and must be reconstructed to get the final flag.

### Objective:
Find all flag fragments inside the logs and combine them in the correct order.

---

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach
This looked like a typical "flag fragments inside logs" challenge.
I expected the flag to be broken into multiple FLAGPART entries that appear in sequential order.

Plan:
Search for keywords like picoCTF, FLAGPART, or braces

Collect all fragment pieces

Remove duplicates

Combine in correct order to form the final flag

---

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 1. Download the logs
```bash
wget https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_amiable_citadel/49cec6157142f24a599f4164d5b63322c2494f801390d6f22eb91b3aa592bc66/server.log
```
### 2. Search for picoCTF in the logs
```bash
grep -i "picoCTF" server.log
```
I found multiple repeated fragments:
```bash
picoCTF{us3_
picoCTF{us3_
sk1lls_
```
### 3. Search for all flagged parts
```bash
grep -i "FLAGPART" server.log
```
This revealed four unique segments repeating throughout:
```bash
picoCTF{us3_
y0urlinux_
sk1lls_
cedfa5fb}
```
### 4. Combine fragments in logical order
Flag parts clearly form a readable phrase:

- picoCTF{us3_

- y0urlinux_

- sk1lls_

- cedfa5fb}
Putting them together:
```bash
picoCTF{us3_y0urlinux_sk1lls_cedfa5fb}
```

## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{us3_y0urlinux_sk1lls_cedfa5fb}
```

## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- Extracting repeated patterns from logs using grep

- Understanding how CTF flags are often fragmented in logs

- Recognizing unique vs repeated entries

- Assembling flag fragments logically

- Importance of sequential analysis in forensics challenges

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- Automate fragment extraction using a small Python script

- Use regex to capture all alphanumeric sequences in one pass

- Search for patterns more efficiently with grep -Eo
