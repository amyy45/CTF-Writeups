# 🧩 CTF Challenge Writeup  
**Challenge Name:** Local Authority  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Platform:** picoCTF 2022  
**Author:** LT 'SYREAL' JONES

## 🔍 1. Challenge Description

The challenge presents a simple web-based login page with the following prompt:

> *“Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.”*

A hint is provided:

> *“How is the password checked on this website?”*

This immediately suggests that authentication logic may be handled **client-side**, which is a common vulnerability in introductory web exploitation challenges.

---

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach

Given:
- **Web Exploitation** category  
- **Easy** difficulty  
- A direct hint about **password checking**

Key observations:
- Secure authentication should always occur server-side
- Client-side JavaScript is fully visible and controllable by the user
- Hardcoded credentials in JavaScript are a common beginner-level flaw

The objective is therefore to **inspect the client-side code** and determine how login validation is performed.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 3.1 Launch the Challenge Instance
Click the provided **website** link to open the login page.

The page displays:
- A username field
- A password field
- A login button
- A message indicating login failure upon incorrect input

### 3.2 Inspect Client-Side Files
Open **Developer Tools** (`Ctrl + Shift + I`) and navigate to the **Sources** tab.

The following files are visible:
- `login.php`
- `secure.js`
- `style.css`

The file `secure.js` is of particular interest, as it suggests client-side security logic.


### 3.3 Analyze Authentication Logic
Opening `secure.js` reveals the following function:

```js
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
    if (username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765')
    {
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```
This confirms that:
- Authentication is performed **entirely in JavaScript**
- Credentials are **hardcoded**
- No server-side validation is involved
### 3.4 Use Extracted Credentials
Using the discovered credentials:

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: strongPassword098765
Enter them into the login form and submit.
### 3.5 Flag Reveal
Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to an admin page which displays the flag directly on the page:
```text
picoCTF{5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_05df90c8}
```

## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_05df90c8}
```

## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- Client-side authentication provides no real security
- JavaScript source code can always be inspected and modified
- Hardcoded credentials are a critical security flaw
- Authentication logic must always be enforced server-side
- Browser Developer Tools are essential for web exploitation

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- Always inspect JavaScript files early in web challenges
- Never trust client-side validation mechanisms
- Look for hardcoded secrets before attempting brute-force or bypasses
- Use the provided hints to guide analysis efficiently
- Treat all client-side logic as attacker-controlled
