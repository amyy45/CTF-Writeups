**Challenge Name:** Inspect HTML

## 🔍 1. Challenge Description

The challenge provides a simple webpage with the following prompt:

> *“Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.”*

No visible input fields or interactive elements are present on the page.  
The challenge name **Inspect HTML** strongly hints that the solution lies within the page’s source code rather than through server-side interaction.

---

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach

Given:
- **Web Exploitation** category  
- **Easy** difficulty  
- Challenge name explicitly referencing **HTML inspection**

Key observations:
- Flags are often hidden in HTML comments
- Client-side content is fully visible to the user
- Viewing page source or inspecting elements is the intended approach

The goal is therefore to **inspect the HTML source** of the webpage and search for hidden information.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 3.1 Launch the Challenge Instance
Click the provided **website** link to open the webpage.

The page displays:
- A heading titled **“On Histiaeus”**
- A short paragraph of historical text
- A source reference to Wikipedia

No flag is visible in the rendered content.

---

### 3.2 Inspect the Page Source
Open **Developer Tools** using:
- Right-click → **Inspect**
- Or `Ctrl + Shift + I`

Navigate to the **Elements** tab to examine the HTML structure.

---

### 3.3 Locate Hidden Content
Scrolling through the HTML reveals a comment at the bottom of the `<body>` section:

```html
<!--picoCTF{1n5p3ct0r_0f_h7ml_fd5d57bd}-->
```
This confirms that:
- The flag is stored directly in the HTML
- It is hidden from view using an HTML comment
- No JavaScript execution or server interaction is required

---
## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{1n5p3ct0r_0f_h7ml_fd5d57bd}
```

---
## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- HTML comments are visible to anyone inspecting the source
- Client-side hiding does not equal security
- Developer Tools are essential for web exploitation
- Many beginner challenges rely on observation rather than exploitation
- Always inspect the DOM before attempting complex attacks

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- Always check HTML comments early in web challenges
- Use both View Page Source and Inspect Element
- Do not assume visible content is the full page
- Treat all client-side content as accessible
- Follow challenge names and hints closely
