## 🔍 1. Challenge Description

The challenge presents a simple webpage with the following prompt:

> *“Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.”*

The page displays a short article titled **“On Includes”** along with a button labeled **“Say hello”**.  
No visible flag is shown on the rendered page.

The challenge name **Includes** hints that the solution involves examining **included files** such as external JavaScript or CSS resources.

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach

Given:
- **Web Exploitation** category  
- **Easy** difficulty  
- The title **Includes**

Key observations:
- Modern web pages often load external JavaScript and CSS files
- These files are fully accessible to the client
- Flags are commonly hidden in comments inside included resources

The intended approach is therefore to **inspect externally included files** using browser developer tools.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 3.1 Launch the Challenge Instance
Click the provided **website** link to open the webpage.

The page contains:
- Informational text about include directives
- A source reference to Wikipedia
- A button labeled **“Say hello”**

No suspicious content is visible initially.

### 3.2 Inspect Included Files
Open **Developer Tools** (`Ctrl + Shift + I`) and navigate to the **Sources** tab.

The following files are loaded:
- `(index)`
- `script.js`
- `style.css`

Both external files are inspected for hidden content.

### 3.3 Inspect JavaScript File
Opening `script.js` reveals the following code:

```js
function greetings()
{
    alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

// f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
```
This appears to be part of the flag, but not the complete value.

### 3.4 Inspect CSS File
Next, style.css is examined. Near the top of the file, a comment is found:
```css
/* picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_ */
```

This confirms:
- The flag is split across multiple included files
- Both parts must be combined to reconstruct the full flag

### 3.5 Reconstruct the Flag
Combining the fragments from both files:
- From *style.css*: picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_
- From *script.js*: f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
Results in the complete flag.

## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
```

## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- External JavaScript and CSS files are fully visible to users
- Sensitive data should never be stored client-side
- Flags can be split across multiple included resources
- Comments in source files are easily overlooked but critical
- Inspecting all loaded files is essential in web challenges

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- Always inspect all included files early
- Check both JavaScript and CSS for hidden comments
- Look for partial flags that require reconstruction
- Treat client-side resources as attacker-controlled
- Follow challenge titles closely for hints
