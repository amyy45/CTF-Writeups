# 🧩 CTF Challenge Writeup  
**Challenge Name:** GET aHEAD  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Platform:** picoCTF 2021

## 🔍 1. Challenge Description

The challenge presents a website with the following description:

> *"Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition"*

A single webpage is provided with two buttons — **"Choose Red"** (GET) and **"Choose Blue"** (POST).  
The challenge name **GET aHEAD** strongly hints at using the **HEAD** HTTP method, which is neither GET nor POST.

---

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach

Given:
- **Web Exploitation** category  
- **Easy** difficulty  
- The title pun: **GET aHEAD** → `HEAD` HTTP method

Key observations:
- The page source (visible in DevTools) shows two forms — one using `method="GET"` and one using `method="POST"`
- HTTP has more methods beyond GET and POST — `HEAD` returns only response **headers**, no body
- The flag is likely embedded in the HTTP response **headers** when a HEAD request is made
- No brute force or injection required — just the right HTTP method

The intended approach is to **send a HEAD request** to the server and inspect the response headers.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 3.1 Inspect the Page Source
Opening DevTools (F12) and inspecting the HTML reveals two forms:

```html
<!-- Red panel -->
<form action="index.php" method="GET">
  <input type="submit" value="Choose Red">
</form>

<!-- Blue panel -->
<form action="index.php" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" value="Choose Blue">
</form>
```

This confirms that GET and POST are both covered — but **HEAD** is not used by either button.

### 3.2 Send a HEAD Request Using curl
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -I http://wily-courier.picoctf.net:63304/
```

The `-I` flag tells curl to send a **HEAD** request, which fetches only the HTTP response headers.

### 3.3 Read the Response Headers
The terminal output looks like this:

```txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:45:01 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.34
flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_8b13f07}
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

The flag is right there in the **`flag:`** response header! ✅

```

## 📚 5. Key Learnings

- HTTP has many methods beyond GET and POST — including **HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH**
- The **HEAD** method returns only response headers, with no response body — useful for checking metadata
- Servers can embed sensitive information inside **custom HTTP response headers**
- Challenge names and wordplay are valuable hints — "GET aHEAD" = use HEAD method
- Browser DevTools and `curl` are essential tools for web exploitation challenges
- Security through obscurity (hiding flags in headers) is not a reliable defense

---

## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time

- Always pay attention to the **challenge name** — it often hints at the solution
- Check HTTP response headers early when exploring web challenges
- Use `curl -I` or `curl -v` to quickly inspect headers without a browser
- Explore all HTTP methods (GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE) when a web challenge seems stuck
- Use browser DevTools → Network tab → inspect response headers for every request
