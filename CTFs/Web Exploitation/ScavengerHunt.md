**Challenge Name:** Scavenger Hunt

## 🔍 1. Challenge Description

The challenge presents a website with the following description:

> *“There is some interesting information hidden around this site. Can you find it?”*

A single webpage is provided with minimal visible content.  
The challenge name **Scavenger Hunt** strongly suggests that the flag is split into multiple parts hidden across different web resources.

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach

Given:
- **Web Exploitation** category  
- **Easy** difficulty  
- Explicit mention of *hidden information*

Key observations:
- Web applications often expose sensitive data through client-side files
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and configuration files are publicly accessible
- No brute force is required; careful inspection is sufficient

The intended approach is to **systematically inspect all available client-side resources**.

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 3.1 Inspect HTML Source
Viewing the page source reveals an HTML comment:

```html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{ -->
```
This provides **Part 1** of the flag.

### 3.2 Inspect CSS File
The linked stylesheet (`mycss.css`) contains the following comment:
```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```
This reveals **Part 2**.

### 3.3 Check (`robots.txt`)
Navigating to (`robots.txt`) shows:
```txt
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```
This provides **Part 3** and hints toward Apache configuration files.

### 3.4 Inspect (`.htaccess`)
Accessing the Apache configuration file (`.htaccess`) reveals:
```txt
# Part 4: 3s_2_l00k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```
This gives **Part 4** and hints at macOS metadata files.

### 3.5 Inspect (`.DS_Store`)
Following the hint, the macOS metadata file (`.DS_Store`) is accessed.
It displays:
```txt
Congrats! You've completed the scavenger hunt! Part 5: _9588550}
```
This provides the final fragment of the flag.

## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{h4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_l00k_9588550}
```

---
## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- Client-side files are always accessible to users
- HTML, CSS, JS, and configuration files can leak sensitive data
- (`robots.txt`) can expose hidden paths
- Apache configuration files may be publicly readable
- Security through obscurity is ineffective

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- Inspect page source immediately
- Always check linked CSS and JavaScript files
- Never ignore (`robots.txt`)
- Look for platform-specific files like (`.DS_Store`)
- Follow hints carefully instead of brute forcing
