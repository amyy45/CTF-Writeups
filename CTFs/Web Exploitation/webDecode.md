# 🧩 CTF Challenge Writeup  
**Challenge Name:** WebDecode

## 🔍 1. Challenge Description
The challenge provides a simple website with the instruction:

> *“Do you know how to use the web inspector? Start searching here to find the flag.”*

An additional hint states that **the flag may or may not be encoded** and suggests inspecting **other files included by the web page**, implying that the flag is not directly visible in the main HTML content.

The objective is to locate and decode the hidden flag using browser developer tools.

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach
Given:
- **Web Exploitation** category  
- **Easy** difficulty  
- Explicit mention of the **web inspector**

The likely approach involves:
- Inspecting client-side resources
- Checking secondary HTML pages
- Looking for encoded data inside attributes or comments

Rather than server-side exploitation, this challenge focuses on **client-side inspection**.

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 3.1 Open the Challenge Instance
The challenge instance is launched via the provided link, loading a basic webpage with navigation options such as **Home**, **About**, and **Contact**.
### 3.2 Open Browser Developer Tools
Open the browser’s developer tools:
- Chrome / Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + I`
- Firefox: `F12`

Navigate to the **Sources** tab to view all files loaded by the webpage.
### 3.3 Inspect Included Files
Under the page’s domain, multiple resources are visible:
- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `style.css`
- Images and font files

Font (`.woff2`) and image files are irrelevant for this challenge. The focus is on **HTML and CSS files**.
### 3.4 Inspect `about.html`
Opening `about.html` reveals a `<section>` element with a suspicious custom attribute:

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZjZmNmI3OGF9">
```
The value of the notify_true attribute appears to be Base64-encoded.
### 3.5 Decode the Encoded String
The encoded value is decoded using the terminal:

```bash
echo "cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZjZmNmI3OGF9" | base64 -d
```
Output:
```bash
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_f6f6b78a}
```

## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_f6f6b78a}
```

## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- Flags may be hidden in secondary HTML files, not just the main page
- Always inspect custom HTML attributes, not only comments or visible text
- Base64 encoding is commonly used to obscure flags in easy web challenges
- Browser developer tools are essential for client-side security analysis
- Encoding does not provide security; it only obscures data

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- Inspect all linked pages (about, contact, etc.) early
- Ignore binary resources (fonts, images) unless explicitly hinted
- Use global search in DevTools for encoded strings
- Check for hidden data inside HTML attributes
- Maintain a checklist for web-based CTF challenges
