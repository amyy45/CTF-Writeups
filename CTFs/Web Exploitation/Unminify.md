# 🧩 CTF Challenge Writeup  
**Challenge Name:** Unminify  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Platform:** picoCTF 2024

## 🔍 1. Challenge Description
The challenge presents a website with the following description:

> *“I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster! Browse here, and find the flag!”*

The hint suggests thinking about **tools developers use when working on a website**, and mentions that **many text editors and browsers include formatting**.  
This implies the website source code is **minified** and needs to be **unminified (prettified)** to reveal the hidden flag.

The objective is to inspect the webpage source, format it properly, and locate the flag.

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach
Given:
- **Web Exploitation** category  
- **Easy** difficulty  
- Keywords like *minification* and *formatting*  

The logical approach is:
- Inspect the client-side HTML
- Use browser developer tools to **prettify** the minified source
- Search for the flag once readability is restored

This challenge does **not** involve server-side exploitation or decoding—only proper inspection.

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 3.1 Open the Challenge Instance
Click the **“here”** link to launch the challenge instance, which loads a simple webpage with no visible flag.
### 3.2 Open Browser Developer Tools
Open the browser’s developer tools:
- **Chrome / Edge (Windows/Linux):** `Ctrl + Shift + I`
- **Chrome (macOS):** `Cmd + Option + I`
- **Firefox:** `F12`

Navigate to the **Elements** tab to inspect the HTML source.
### 3.3 Prettify (Unminify) the HTML
The HTML source appears compressed into minimal spacing, making it hard to read.

To fix this:
- Click inside the HTML panel
- Use the **Pretty Print / Format (`{}`)** option  
  **OR**
- Right-click → **View Page Source**, copy the code, and format it using a code editor (e.g., VS Code)

Once formatted, the structure becomes readable.
### 3.4 Search for the Flag
After unminifying the HTML:
- Press `Ctrl + F` / `Cmd + F`
- Search for:
```yaml
picoCTF{
```
This reveals the flag embedded inside a class attribute of a `<p>` tag:

```html
<p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_622b2c88}"></p>
```
The flag is directly visible—no decoding required.

## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_622b2c88}
```

## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- Minification reduces readability, not security
- Browsers must receive the full source code
- Prettifying HTML can instantly expose hidden data
- Flags may be hidden inside HTML attributes, not visible text
- Developer tools are critical for web security analysis

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- IAlways prettify minified code before deeper analysis
- Use search "(picoCTF{)" immediately after formatting
- Inspect HTML attributes, not just visible content
- Do not assume encoding or encryption unless hinted
- Treat client-side code as fully accessible
