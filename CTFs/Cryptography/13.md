# 🧩 CTF Challenge Writeup  
**Challenge Name:** 13  
**Category:** Cryptography  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Platform:** picoCTF  
**Author:** Alex Fulton / Daniel Tunitis  
**Date:** *08-01-26*

## 🔍 1. Challenge Description
This challenge provides a **ROT13-encoded string** directly in the problem description and asks the player to decode it.

The description explicitly hints at the solution:
> *Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is?*

The objective is simple:  
➡️ **Apply the ROT13 cipher to the given string and recover the flag.**

---

## 🧠 2. Initial Thoughts / Approach
Given the *Cryptography* category and *Easy* difficulty, I expected:

- A classical substitution cipher  
- No file interaction or complex tooling  
- A direct transformation of the given text  

Since the challenge name is **13** and the description explicitly mentions **ROT13**, the encoding method was immediately clear.

ROT13 is a Caesar cipher that shifts each letter **13 positions** in the alphabet while leaving numbers and symbols unchanged.

## 🛠️ 3. Steps to Solve

### 1. Identify the encoded string
The challenge provides the following encoded text:
```yaml
cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}
```
### 2. Apply ROT13 decoding
ROT13 decoding can be performed easily using the Unix tr command.
```bash
echo "cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```
### 3. Observe the decoded output
```yaml
picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
```
The decoded string matches the standard picoCTF flag format, confirming the solution.

## 🧩  4. Final Flag 
```bash
picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
```

## 📚 5. Key Learnings
- ROT13 is a simple Caesar cipher with a fixed shift of 13
- Challenge titles and descriptions often directly indicate the solution
- ROT13 affects only alphabetic characters; numbers and symbols remain unchanged
- The tr command is useful for fast character substitution
- Easy cryptography challenges focus on recognition rather than complexity

---
## 🚀 6. Improvements for Next Time
- Memorize common classical ciphers (ROT13, A1Z26, Atbash)
- Build a small script to brute-force Caesar shifts automatically
- Practice identifying ciphers from challenge names and hints
- Avoid overthinking when explicit hints are provided
